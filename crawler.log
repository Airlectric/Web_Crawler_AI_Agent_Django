2025-05-02 18:00:23,467 - INFO - Raw content: The course will assess the profound transformations in the world energy landscape due to rapid technological change and concern about climate change. A review of global energy security and how key countries and regions view their energy challenges and strengths will be carried out. It will focus on evaluation of the considerations of impact international relations and strategies, and how energy security can be shaped by geopolitical factors, e.g., the rise of nationalism and weakening of the post-World War II global order. Objectives The objective of the course is to: . Describe the major energy security issues facing the world and specific regions and countries today and how this may evolve going forward . Discuss how particular countries and regions view their energy strengths and challenges and how this perception impacts foreign and security policies. . Explain how geopolitics might affect energy trends and how geopolitics could be impacted by energy developments
